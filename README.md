## North America Job Offer Comparator

A **job offer comparison application** for graduating UBC CS students. Students can choose the best job offer that they’ve
got according to locations, their own preferences and most importantly, to check whether students got low-balled offers 
or not. I may use this application for choosing job offers.<br>
<br>
First of all, the information (e.g. office location, average salary) of some top companies <em>(e.g. MANGA)</em> is 
stored inside the system already. At the same time, the living cost of North American big cities <em>(e.g. Vancouver, 
Toronto, New York, Palo Alto, Mountainview …)</em> will be stored inside the system as well. <br>
<br>
For instance, the user can choose which companies he/ she got in, and input the offer into the system *(salary + signing 
bonus + stock)*. **The system will help students calculate the average annual salary in CAD/ USD. Then, the user can choose which city the office is
located in, and the system will return the living cost of that city and the average salary of the workers in that 
company for students and eventually calculate the disposable income (after tax) per year of the students if he/ she 
decides to work there. The user is able to compare multiple offers through a bar chart (based on disposable income) and then make a wise choice.**
